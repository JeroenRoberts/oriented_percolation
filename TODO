-Improve zooming experience. smooth it out
-Optimize JS mouse_position_get
-clean up code.
-Drawrect and zoom (draw rectangle and zoom in on this rectangel). Could use svg to draw the rectangle. put it overtop, so it don't mess with opengl.
-Post-processing: blur , anti aliasing etc..
-make gridlength by just zooming in the x direciotn.



DONE:
-get gl.repeat to work for periodic boundary conditions.ONly works if resolution a power of 2......
-colours is in render now. big efficiency upgrade. look out for this



TODAY:
1) use same vertices for different shader program.
2)BUTTONS
    make em pop out
    overlay the over the canvas.

FOr implementing textu size != render size do: gl.viewport

remove debug stuff once done. ( kind of unneccesary though already very fast)

Pratice smaller texture size. with viewport
